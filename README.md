## Linked List Implementations in C

This repository contains different types of linked list implementations in C programming language. Linked lists are a fundamental data structure used in computer science to organize and manipulate a collection of elements.

## Singly Linked List

A **singly linked list** is a data structure where each element in the list points to the next element. It consists of nodes, where each node contains a data element and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. Singly linked lists are simple and efficient for insertion and deletion operations at the beginning and middle of the list.

## Doubly Linked List

A **doubly linked list** is similar to a singly linked list, but each node contains two references: one pointing to the next node and another pointing to the previous node. This bidirectional linkage allows for more versatile operations such as traversal in both directions and efficient insertion and deletion at both ends of the list.

## Circular Linked List

A **circular linked list** is a variation of a singly linked list where the last node points back to the first node instead of having a null reference. This creates a circular structure, allowing continuous traversal through the list. Circular linked lists are useful for applications where operations need to cycle through a set of elements indefinitely.
